# Project Description
This project aims to detect the presence of heart disease in patients based on several tests conducted on the patient. In addition, the project seeks to determine the contribution of each feature in order to understand the impact of each feature on the result of the AI model. To achieve this, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values are introduced to help detect and mitigate bias in AI systems.

The project utilizes machine learning techniques to develop a model that can accurately detect the presence of heart disease in patients. Additionally, SHAP values are calculated to interpret the model and understand how each feature contributes to the final prediction.

By using SHAP values to diagnose and mitigate bias, the AI system can become more fair and equitable, and less likely to cause harm or perpetuate existing social inequalities. This project serves as a demonstration of how SHAP values can be used to develop more transparent and unbiased AI systems.
This project seeks to detect the presence of heart disease in patients given a number of tests carried out on the patient. Also to determine the 
contributions of each feature in order to know how much the affect the result of the AI model. To do this, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values 
are introduced to help detect and mitigate bias in AI systems.
